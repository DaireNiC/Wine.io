 A conscious effort was made to try not only meet the requirements for the application specification but to to surpass them. Examples of this include the time spent on styling the app, adding the Facebook native plugin(notoriously difficult to implement), using more than two plugins(Facebook, angular fire, firebase, googlemaps, ionicstorage), use of angular binding properties and form controls, and also extensive use of the Navcontroller component as the app has a large amount of pages.
